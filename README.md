# constellation-identifier-app
Identify synthetic line chart images of star constellations.

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (MobileNetV2) to identify star constellations from images.

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload constellation images and receive predictions with confidence scores and brief descriptions.

**Technologies used:**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MobileNetV2
- Streamlit
